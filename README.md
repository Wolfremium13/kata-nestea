# 🍵 Nestea Kata

## 📝 Description

This is a kata to practice TDD and property-based testing. It's inspired by the [MaxibonKata](https://github.com/Karumi/MaxibonKataKotlin).
We're here to work incrementally and to have fun. I'm gonna split the kata in iterations and we're gonna do a retrospective after each iteration:

- [🧑‍🎓 Iteration 1](docs/iteration-1.md)
- [🧑‍🏫 Iteration 2](docs/iteration-2.md)
- [🧑‍🎤 Iteration 3](docs/iteration-3.md)

> 🚨 Important: This is a kata should be done incrementally so apply property-based testing only when you have a "working" solution.
> each iteration increments the complexity of the problem so don't try to solve the whole problem at once.

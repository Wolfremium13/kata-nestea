# 🧑‍🎓 Iteration 1

In this iteration we're gonna implement the first iteration of the kata. We're gonna start with the explanation of the problem.

Kevin really likes Nestea, so on training Fridays he buys a 6-pack of cans for himself and his colleagues. On hot Fridays, several people feel like having Nestea, and it quickly runs out. Other people prefer a 1906 instead, so they won't touch the Nestea, but generally, it's one can per person. We have a smart fridge that keeps track of the remaining cans. If the count reaches 0, it will display that there is no Nestea left on a panel so that you don't have to open it. As a general rule, if someone takes the last can, they should go buy a new pack. It's important to know that our fridge is small, and there's a lot of beer, so only one six-pack can fit at most.

## ❓ Questions to think about

- What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
- What are the different scenarios that can happen?
- Do we need property-based testing for this iteration?

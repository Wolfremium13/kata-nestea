# 🧑‍🎤 Iteration 3

We continue telling the story and it turns out that the Canary Islands have different types of Nestea and not everyone likes all types, so if there is not the type they like in the fridge now, they will not drink it. The elevator has broken down so now our supplier will take longer to restock and it won't be as fast as before so we can't assume there will always be Nestea.

## ❓ Questions to think about

- How can we model the different types of Nestea?
- How we can control the stock of Nestea?

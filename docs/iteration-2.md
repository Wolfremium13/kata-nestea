# 🧑‍🏫 Iteration 2

Continuing with the previous story, sometimes the refrigerator is far away and one person is in charge of bringing the Nestea to the others. We have also contracted a service that can provide us with Nestea when we run out of cans, the fridge is smart so they will now send a message to the supplier. We have seen that the demand for Nestea has grown a lot so we have been able to negotiate more space and now we can fit 2 packs of cans.

## ❓ Questions to think about

- What are the limits on how many cans of Nestea can be taken from the refrigerator?
- How can we test the message to the supplier?
- How many parts of the code needed to be changed to support 2 packs of cans?
